# ATLAS — Decisions & Notes

## Core Insight (from founder, Feb 2026)
The platform's real value is not aggregation — it's convergence detection. Anyone can put congressional trades, insider buys, and institutional flows on one site. The edge is the moment when all three start flowing into the same ticker or sector simultaneously, especially as relevant legislation enters markup or floor vote. That multi-signal pile-up is the highest-conviction trade setup possible. Build everything toward detecting and surfacing that pattern.

## Platform Assessment
Design, UX, and signal framework are well-conceived. The UI is done. The missing piece is a real data pipeline replacing the demo/static trade ideas. Once real Form 4s, congressional disclosures, and 13F data flow through a convergence scorer, this is a product people pay for.

## Key Architectural Decisions

**No hardcoded trade ideas**
All signal cards must be generated by the scoring engine. Manual entries are prototypes only, clearly labeled `[DEMO]`. The platform's credibility depends on this.

**Three hubs + convergence layer, not one big dashboard**
Users should be able to go deep on any single hub independently (Congressional / Insider / Institutional), but the homepage and alerts surface the convergence view first because that's the edge.

**Legislative catalysts are a timing multiplier, not a standalone signal**
A bill vote scheduled in 10 days doesn't generate a signal alone. But it boosts the score of any existing insider/congressional/institutional signal in that sector by +15 points. Bills are an overlay, not a hub.

**Start with Path A (single HTML + APIs), don't over-engineer**
Prove the convergence engine works with real data before converting to Next.js. Once signals are live and the correlation logic is validated, then do the full stack rebuild.

**Finnhub (free) before Polygon ($29/mo)**
Upgrade to Polygon when options flow data is needed (Phase 3+). Finnhub covers real-time quotes for Phase 1.

**Ntfy.sh over Twilio**
Zero cost, zero phone number config. Push to phone via app. Use for personal alerts throughout.

**Clerk over custom auth**
Auth is a solved problem. Only add when sharing with others.

## Price Audit Results (Feb 23, 2026)
Compared TRACKED fallback prices to live market:

| Ticker | Fallback | Actual | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|--------|
| RTX | $205.28 | ~$205 | ✅ Accurate |
| NVDA | $190.00 | ~$190 | ✅ Accurate |
| OXY | $51.70 | ~$51.70 | ✅ Accurate |
| TMDX | $135.50 | ~$135.50 | ✅ Accurate |
| FCX | $64.45 | ~$64.45 | ✅ Accurate |
| META | $648.00 | $655.60 | ✅ Within 1%, in entry zone |
| ITA | $162.00 | $243.65 | ❌ ~50% off — signal stale, original data was wrong |
| WFRD | $17.50 | $104.50 | ❌ 6x off — original data was completely wrong |
| PFE | $26.65 | not checked | ⬜ |
| TSM | $370.54 | not checked | ⬜ |
| SMPL | $33.62 | not checked | ⬜ |

ITA and WFRD demo cards should be updated to reflect correct prices and marked as stale/suspended until new valid signals are generated by the engine.

## Monetization Path (when ready)
- Personal use: $0/mo
- Invite-only: Clerk restrictions
- Paid: $20–50/mo via Stripe — Claude Code can scaffold paywall in one session
- Running cost at full build: ~$30–50/mo (mostly Polygon.io)

- Signal history + backtesting: signal date → score → 30d return → 90d return
- Options chain viewer for tickers with sweep signals (Tradier free tier)
- Calendar view: all legislative dates, earnings, FDA decisions on one calendar
- PDF export: one-click research note from any signal card
- Dark mode toggle
- Universal search bar filtering across all hubs simultaneously
